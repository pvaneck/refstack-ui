Refstack User Interface
=======================

User interface for interacting with the Refstack API.

You can start a development server by doing the following:

Install NodeJS and NPM:

:code:`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -`

:code:`sudo apt-get install nodejs`

Clone the repository and move into it:

:code:`git clone https://github.com/pvaneck/refstack-ui`

:code:`cd refstack-ui`

Install dependencies and start the server:

:code:`npm start`

By default, as noted in package.json, the server will listen on port 8000.
