=======================
Refstack User Interface
=======================

User interface for interacting with the Refstack API.

Setup
=====

You can start a development server by doing the following:

Install NodeJS and NPM:

:code:`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -`

:code:`sudo apt-get install nodejs`

Clone the repository and move into it:

:code:`git clone https://github.com/pvaneck/refstack-ui`

:code:`cd refstack-ui`

Install dependencies and start the server:

:code:`npm start`

Doing this will automatically perform :code:`npm start` and :code:`bower install`
to get all dependencies.

By default, as noted in package.json, the server will use 0.0.0.0:8080.
